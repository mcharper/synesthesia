### Intro
Forked from [Wheelibin](https://github.com/wheelibin)'s excellent [synaesthesia](https://github.com/wheelibin/synaesthesia) project which generates music randomly in the browser.

### What I've added
A visualiser that brings in images when there's a chord change. It still needs some work.
Live demo here: [https://mcharper.github.io/synesthesia/](https://mcharper.github.io/synesthesia/).

### Getting started
    npm install
    npm start

### Credits
 - All [Wheelibin](https://github.com/wheelibin)'s work apart except the visualiser.
